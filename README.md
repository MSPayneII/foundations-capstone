## Reason for choosing this project: 
I wanted to create a digital version of the Magic Eightball that is currently produced by Mattel

## Project Goal: 
Build a digital experience that rivals the experience of playing with the real toy.

## Build Features:
- Users can enter questions to ask the eight ball
- Users will receive a randomized answer to their question via an animation displayed on the eight ball
- Q&As will save and display on screen for users
- Saved Q&As are erased by refreshing the browser


## Technologies:
Technologies:
- Axios
- Express
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## What I am proud of:
- Figuring out a way to combine async and synchronous code and time it so all aspects of the eightball animation flow together
