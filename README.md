## My Process

### Technologies Used:

- Axios
- Express
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Build Features:

- Users can enter questions to ask the eight ball
- Users will receive a randomized answer to their question via an animation displayed on the eight ball
- Q&As will save and display on screen for users
- Saved Q&As are erased by refreshing the browser

## What I am proud of:

- Figuring out a way to combine async and synchronous code and time it so all aspects of the eightball animation flow together

### Continued development

- Build 8-Ball Fortune Teller version 2 in React, using functional components and React Hooks

- Add form validation with visual cues for the user

- Update css variable naming convention

- Add side navigation bar with links to eightball display and saved responses. They will be on separate pages but will display on the main landing page
